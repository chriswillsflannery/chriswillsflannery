              When we went to the market I watched you
            </p>
            <p>
              I watched as you took that first bite of mazamorra and smiled
            </p>
            <p>
							Of course we had to get the combinado
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							You led me through narrow passages
						</p>
						<p>
							past all types of people and all types of food
						</p>
						<p>
							{`I don't think you stopped smiling the whole day`}
						</p>
						<p>
							Sometimes I think about how good that first bite tastes
						</p>
						<p>
							and the one after it, and the one after that
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							I think we should set up shop
						</p>
						<p>
							We can buy a little space for a puesto of our own
						</p>
						<p>
							It can be a tiny corner where we sell chicken and eggs
						</p>
						<p>
							right next to the shop where we sat for a juice
						</p>
						<p>
							Where you used to go when you were a kid
						</p>
						<p>
							You told me you would sit there for hours
						</p>
						<p>
							Doing some homework and watching the dogs play in the dirt
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							I think we could buy anything at the market
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you think someone will sell us a visa?
						</p>
						<p>
							{`Maybe then we won't have to wait so long to be together`}
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
							For Naysha
