            <h3>{`Can you provide an example of a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame the difficulties?`}</h3>
            <p>{`One of the services I worked on in a previous role was the ability to conduct remote clinical trials in a way which more closely reflects how on-prem clinical trials are conducted. It was necessary to introduce the concept of a “visit” to the digital platform. A “Visit” describes a predefined period of time in which the Study Coordinator and the Participant(s) conduct any assessments, including participant assessments and clinician assessments.`}</p>
            <p>{`For this to work, we needed a concept of a “Study visit” as well as a concept of a “participant visit”. The clinician should be able to go into a Study dashboard, and create a configuration for an upcoming Visit for that study. This configuration describes all of the tasks, including participant assessments, checkbox-like tasks, and clinician assessments which are required to be completed on that study visit day. The study visit configuration should also include information like how long that visit should last, and to which Study Schedule Period it pertains.`}</p>
            <p>{`With the study visit configured, the clinician should then be able to go into the individual Participant dashboard, and create a configuration for that individual Participant’s visit, as it pertains to the larger Study Visit. The date, start time and end time are configured as an offset value of the Study Period which the visit pertains to. For example, the clinician may decide that the Participant Visit should start on Day 1 of Study Period 1, become active at 9am, and last 5 hours. Once the configuration is complete for the Participant visit and the clinician saves the configuration, the Visit will populate the Participant’s calendar view. `}</p>
            <p>{`On the day of the Participant Visit, the clinician can open a panel to view information about the visit, such as start and end time, and a task list - including manually launchable assessments which are scoped to that Visit, checkbox-type tasks, and clinician assessments which are scoped to that Visit.`}</p>

            <h3>{`How do you stay current with industry trends and new technologies?`}</h3>
            <p>{`To be clear, I don’t think that “keeping up to date” directly equates to “career growth” or even “becoming a better engineer”, although there is probably some correlation and overlap. I think keeping up with trends is important, but we’ve seen recently in Pieter Levels’ interview on the Lex Fridman podcast that you can hack on the same PHP stack for 20 years and be a wildly successful entrepreneur millionaire. Not everybody needs to be an early adopter to RAG pipelines and Tanstack Query.`}</p>
            <p>{`That being said, there can be a lot of benefit to being an early adopter, depending on how you spin it. Just knowing what RAG is at a conceptual level, and that it is possible, and relatively easy to implement, can plant a seed for a future project or startup. X is one of the best places to discover what’s trending in the hivemind, although it can also be an echo chamber of un-vetted ideas. Yes, Cursor is awesome, but if you’re only learning about it today, that’s totally OK. You’re going to be just fine.`}</p>
            <p>{`At the end of the day, the most important tech stack, library, framework, technology, etc. is the one which best does the job, not necessarily the one which is the most hyped on tiktok. Yes, Vercel is great for early startups, but it may not be the right solution at scale. There is nuance to everything. As with most great engineering designs, the correct response is almost always “it depends.”`}</p>

            <h3>{`What excites you about NextJS?`}</h3>
            <p>{`In a previous job I worked on a major version migration from NextJS 13 to 14. It was a haul. We had a huge application, with hundreds of components, pages, and utils. Next 14 uses a new compiler technique and in looking at the numbers in NewRelic after finishing the migration, so far as I can tell, performance boosts seem to reflect the numbers that Vercel boasts about on the NextJS website. I’m still getting used to the App router and logical groupings of utils and components.`}</p>
            <p>{`Overall Next14 is a good way to build apps. It’s easy to stand up a full stack application rather quickly and get it deployed. I’m not sure about how I feel with the Vercel environment as a whole - and how there seems to be increasing vendor lock-in as the complexity of your application scales. On the one hand, Vercel is extremely simple to set up and get rolling. Documentation is fairly robust, and I like that their secrets manager partitions your secrets by environment as a configuration option (rather than say, in GCP, where you need to signify that a particular secret is for a particular environment by prefixing its name like prod_MY_VAR. Vercel is great for indie hacker startup founders, it’s great for personal projects, and it’s great for folks who don’t want to get bogged down in infra and cloud stuff early on. The dashboard is friendly, simple monitoring and logging are easy to navigate, and the UX is generally good. Seems like a good chunk of the OG React team has since moved over to work on Vercel.`}</p>
            <p>{`But the downsides, yeesh.`}</p>
            <p>{`When you start to scale, the costs grow - fast. (https://www.indiehackers.com/post/vercel-is-ridiculously-expensive-4d7bce8ca8) And now, here’s where the really ugly anecdotal stuff comes in. When I was working at a startup, Vercel went down globally, and our users with it. More than 30 minutes passed before Vercel acknowledged the outage on their status page, and they really seemed to bury the truth - minimizing the scale of the problem. This happened just 2 weeks after our users experienced regional outages, where again, the Vercel team was somewhat slow, and somewhat moreso untruthful in acknowledging the scope and impact of the problem. Our team got fed up with Vercel, and moved to GCP.`}</p>
            <p>{`As you can tell, my thoughts on NextJS are somewhat overshadowed by my thoughts on Vercel. It’s hard to separate the art from the artist. But I think what excites me most is just the general trend in the way things are moving. Next is like the gold standard of frontend and middle-of-the-stack development for the foreseeable future. The community around it is robust. But there is a healthy amount of space for pushback and differing opinions - which is almost always a good thing.`}</p>

          <h3>{`Do you have a strong track record at companies building complicated technology?`}</h3>
          <p>{`In my last role, I worked on the next generation of a multi-tenant clinical trial platform, which included a Next/TS frontend, a TS edge server, and various Golang backend microservices. Many of the features I worked on interfaced with several services - for example, I built a localizations workspace for managing translated study content (Not all of our clinical trial coordinators, nor studies, nor study sites, nor study participants, live in english-speaking countries). This workspace interfaced with a GoLang microservice (serving as a repository and transformation hub for localization data) and AWS s3 pre-signed URLs (for storing translation files and allowing easy download on the FE), and built a custom secure GraphQL file upload/download to store and retrieve the localized JSON strings.`}</p>
          <p>{`Before that, at Caesars, one of the primary projects I directed was overhauling a massive React/Redux application (a hybrid mobile sports betting application, built with web tech but compiled using Apache Cordova to generate a native mobile app), and completely rebuilding the whole thing in TypeScript. A few reasons why - `}</p>
          <p>{`1. The JS interfaced with a gateway API server which used REST, and because the FE was all written in JS, there was no concept of type-sharing across the API boundary. Type schemas were all over the place. Constantly changing due to shifting product direction. Issues with versioning and forward/backward compatibility. Types could have been inferred by creating JSDoc comments in the (Scala) API layer but even that would need to be manually updated each time some functionality was changed. I’m not sure if TRPC existed or anyone was really talking about it at that time. That might have been too early. We did talk about dropping in GraphQL, but that would be a massive migration.`}</p>
          <p>{`2. Tons and tons of sports data coming in from BE services (think things like, which betting markets are available, who is playing today, who is playing tomorrow, and in which leagues, and in which tournaments, and odds changing in real-time). This sports data was essentially uncontrolled. Response schema was documented with swagger but on the FE it was the wild west.`}</p>
          <p>{`So, we started from the ground up using a “soft” TS adoption model. Essential configs and utils were converted first, with everything else getting “any’s”. We tracked which modules and features were converted so far with a shared spreadsheet. Everyone got on board - all hands on deck. Some of the most painful moments were converting Cordova library integrations - Cordova by this point was already towards the end of its life (was soon to be replaced with Capacitor) and had many outdated libraries or fixed forked versions - several with no TS support. Some of these had to be manually given type declaration files on our end. Then, there was still the issue of type safety across the API boundary. As a naive implementation, Core Entity types were generated based on JSDoc/OpenAPI. This was around the time I left Caesars - I’m not sure if they have adopted a more robust type-boundary solution in the time since.`}</p>

          <h3>{`What is the need to upgrade from NextJS 13 to NextJS 14? I want to understand the rationale behind the upgrade as well as what is involved as far as codebase changes.`}</h3>
          <p>{`The biggest changes are structural changes around routing, some performance improvements, and Server Components.`}</p>
          <p>{`Next 14 fully embraces the App Router pattern. This means that instead of a top level “pages” folder, we have a top level “app” folder. Previously, any file in the pages directory would become a route, whereas now, only certain files with certain naming conventions (’page’ for frontend, ‘route’ for api, for example) within the app directory become routes. There is also a new dedicated “layout” naming convention for any file which serves as the base layout for the files within that route. Previously, we would have to roll our own layout solution to accomplish the same.`}</p>
          <p>{`In the new version, the Link component itself becomes an anchor tag, rather than needing to wrap an anchor tag. Simple change, but a very good one. Intuitive. Also in the new version, there are some new methods on the useRouter hook, and they’ve removed some event listeners and overall made the whole pattern of using the hook feel more “react-y”. In other words, changes are caught “reactively” (like having a useEffect “listen” for changes to the URL params) rather than proactively setting up a new listener object.`}</p>
          <p>{`Next 14 uses Turbopack, which is a next-gen compiler and outperforms webpack on several metrics. It has faster refresh rates, meaning hot-reloading is faster, and we get better build times as well. Next 13 primarily used webpack as a build tool, but later introduced turbopack as an experimental, semi-supported configuration option.`}</p>
          <p>{`The last big change is that Next 14 encourages the use of Server Components. This involves reviewing all components and deciding which can be server-rendered and which must be client only. In effect, this creates a 3-tiered rendering system where server-rendered HTML is compiled first, and populates the “bones” of the webpage, then server components get dropped in, and then finally, client components. This attempts to create an extremely buttery user experience, where it doesn’t really “feel” like you have to wait for things to become interactive.`}</p>
